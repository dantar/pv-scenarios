        <h1>Welcome!</h1>

        <p>
            Wanna play a game? Here's how!
        </p>

        <p>
            This game takes place in a few real locations.
            The locations are shown on an interactive map. 
            You'll see it when you close this window.
        </p>

        <div class="image-with-caption">
            <img src="~/images/introduction-map.png" />
        </div>

        <p>
            Every location has a game you should solve.
            When you tap a location you are provided with the instructions on how to pass that game.
            Every game assumes that you go to that location to find out the clues that are necessary to pass the game.
        </p>

        <p>
            Every game is passed by providing a number code. 
            Just type in the code and press the "GO!" button to see if the game is passed or not.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            There is no penalty for trying out wrong codes.
            When you press GO with the right number code, the game is passed. 
            Otherwise you'll be asked to try again.
        </p>

        <p>
            You must pass <bold>all games</bold> in all locations in order to complete the whole game!
        </p>

        <p>
            On the map there are other icons.
        </p>

        <div class="image-with-caption">
            <img src="~/images/introduction-info.png" />
        </div>

        <p>
            This one in the upper left is used to bring up these instructions again. 
            Get back to these instructions as often as you need.
        </p>

        <div class="image-with-caption">
            <img src="~/images/introduction-menu.png" />
        </div>

        <p>
            These buttons in the lower right allow you to center the map at:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>all the game places</li>
            <li>all the game places including your position</li>
            <li>just your position</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In case your position is needed on the map, your device will be asked whether you want to allow the application to use your GPS. 
            Please allow it to use it so that you can see your position on the map.
        </p>
